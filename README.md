# PongGame

PongGame is a clone of the classic game called [Pong](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong).
In this case i've written it in Python with the PyGame library and i wanted it to be really simple and no longer than 200 lines of code.
Just made it for fun and to learn how to use PyGame library, i hope someone can find it useful too.

# Features

* Similar to old Pong game
* Two players game
* The movement of the ball is diagonal, really simple
* The code is easy to learn and modify

# Things that could be added

I wanted to leave this things our so far so the code dont get longer and more complex, but it could be nice to upgrade the game with some of this features

* More complex ball movement
* Game score for each player
* Game Menu to choose between many game types
* Play against AI
* Funnier game mechanics (multiple balls, faster and slower balls, drunk balls, just to name a few)

# How to play

Player 1 use the keys "w" and "s" to move
Player 2 use arrows keys to move
Just like the old classic, you must not let the ball hit the border behind you
After one player wins, the game restarts until you use the "Escape" key or just close the window
